<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Hello Humans! I am Christian Leonard. I am a student who is in the 11th grade at Brockton High School. Throughout my courses, I'm taking high-level classes to get a better chance of going to an Ivy League University, <a href= "https://www.harvard.edu/"> Harvard University </a>. Also, I'm currently taking a computer science class, Code Lab, taught by Mr. Clifford.</p>

<p>Throughout my life, I study to one day become an Engineer. I want to expand my knowledge about designs and with Mr. Clifford's help, I believe I can do it! I am currently taking Web Design with Mr. Francois. Every day, I would try to exercise on the weeknights and the weekends, I would go to the gym. I workout because it is one of the healthiest things to do. I'm also eating fruits, protein, vegetables, grains, and dairy. My favorite sport is soccer and I would play the sport sometimes because I have limited time to practice in either the weekend or weeknight. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to <a href="http://www.americancadrekarate.com/"> karate </a> to defend myself against people who physically hurt people. Also, I like to dance on curtain occasions because it makes me feel better. Every Sunday, I would go to church with my brother, mother, and my grandmother. I am both <a href="https://stoughtoncatholic.org/"> Catholic </a> and a <a href= "https://www.christianity.com/"> Christian </a>. In school, I would work on Algebra 1 and 2 because I have a feeling it could be on my <a href="https://signup.collegeboard.org/accepted-everywhere/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw0IDtBRC6ARIsAIA5gWuqWVFW__ywBT6WZsZGGaSxMgrfK0AGLImlsYlJQutUg35pAzINWZ8aAjN-EALw_wcB&s_kwcid=AL!4330!3!344858223035!e!!g!!sat%27s&ef_id=Cj0KCQjw0IDtBRC6ARIsAIA5gWuqWVFW__ywBT6WZsZGGaSxMgrfK0AGLImlsYlJQutUg35pAzINWZ8aAjN-EALw_wcB:G:s&s_kwcid=AL!4330!3!344858223035!e!!g!!sat%27s"> SAT's </a> someday. Working with other people can help me study for upcoming exams which can be considered a skill. I love to watch <a href="https://www.amctheatres.com/movies"> movies </a>, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/83"> television shows </a>, and <a href= "https://www.netflix.com/browse/genre/7424"> anime </a>.</p>

<h2>Family</h2>

<p>My family is very important to me. My parents both graduated in universities in <a href="https://finca.org/where-we-work/latin-america/haiti/?gclid=Cj0KCQjw0IDtBRC6ARIsAIA5gWsjQD2I_knbDOg0QBFjmfIawjsrjt-6EobZVT149Pvt6dbkSzHw0nYaAj-uEALw_wcB"> Haiti </a>, then went to college again, in the U.S.A. They both had great jobs in Haiti where my mother was the Chief Accountant who worked for the Government. My mother got a bachelor's degree in Business Admissions/Accountant. My dad's job was as a physics teacher. My father got a master's degree in Physics. They moved because they wanted to have children. Throughout my life, I had a wonderful time because my parents were there. In my family, I have a mother, father, brother, and grandmother. My brother and I lived in Brockton for most of our lives.</p>

<p>My younger brother, Ralph, age 14, is thinking of becoming a <a href= "https://www.thebalancecareers.com/computer-programmer-job-description-salary-and-skills-2061823"> Programmer </a>. As of right now, my father works as a co-teacher in <a href="https://www.bpsma.org/schools/middle-schools/south"> South Middle School </a> and my mother works as a <a href="http://www.aarc.org/careers/how-to-become-an-rt/"> Respiratory Therapist </a>. They both tried so hard to help us with our goals. Sometimes, my dad helps me with my homework in <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics"> Physics </a>.</p>

<h2>Culture</h2>

<p>In Haiti, my parents would wear different types of clothes that represented their culture. As of right now, my parents would wear regular clothes from stores in America. However, my mother and grandmother would still cook the same food they did in Haiti. For example, they would make <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/255839/haitian-beef-patties/"> Haitian Style: Beef Patties </a>, <a href="https://www.caribbeangreenliving.com/how-to-make-haitian-accra-an-updated-version/"> Haitian Accra </a>, <a href="https://www.caribbeangreenliving.com/bouillon-beef-and-veggies-soup-2/"> Haitian Bouillon Soup </a>, etc. They didn't want to forget their own home. The reason why my parents moved here was that America provides opportunities for my brother and I. They were also afraid that we would not be born. Many people from Haitian went to America to get a better lifestyle as well.</p>



<h2>Music</h2>

<p>For Music, they've listened to Haitian music, but I didn't understand what the lyrics were. Usually, at a party, they would keep dance around until they couldn't dance anymore. My mom said that Haitian music was also part of their culture because they wouldn't be the people they are today. Many people from Haiti listen to music from America because they want to try something new. It also applies to cultures. My brother doesn't really understand the music. Only my parents and my grandmother understands them.</p>
